<p> Beyond my technical vocation, I am a passionate runner with years of dedication to the sport. 
    My persistence is mirrored not only on the track but also in my academic and professional pursuits. 
    Participating in running events is more than a hobby; it's a reflection of my commitment to discipline and excellence.
    
    As an avid traveler, I relish the opportunity to immerse myself in diverse cultures, which has enriched my worldview and infused my work with a unique perspective. 
    This pursuit has taken me across the globe, to the United States — an epicenter of cutting-edge technology and a pulsating hub of entrepreneurial spirit — and to Japan, where enduring traditions are woven seamlessly with the fabric of cultural opulence.
    This cultural curiosity extends to my love for languages, with Japanese being my current linguistic venture. 
    It's a journey through complex characters and captivating idioms that challenges my learning and broaden my perception of the cultural world.
    
    Volunteering holds a special place in my heart, especially when it comes to mentoring exchange students. 
    I take pride in easing their transition, introducing them to the vibrant culture and life in Munich, and fostering an environment of intercultural understanding.
    
    Let's make the future brighter together.</p>
