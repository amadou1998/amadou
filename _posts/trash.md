The image you've uploaded appears to contain a formula for the Lipschitz constant \( L_k \) of a kernel function with respect to its first argument. Specifically, the Lipschitz constant is defined as the maximum norm of the gradient of the kernel function with respect to the first argument over all points in the space \( X \).

The formula is given as:
\[ L_k = \max_{x, x' \in X} \left\| \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial k(x,x')}{\partial x_1} \\ \vdots \\ \frac{\partial k(x,x')}{\partial x_d} \end{bmatrix} \right\| \]

This is essentially the maximum gradient norm across the entire space, which can be interpreted as the steepest slope found anywhere on the surface defined by the kernel function \( k \).

To find the Lipschitz constant for the partial derivative kernel function \( k^{\partial_i} \), you would follow a similar process but for the kernel's derivative function. The Lipschitz constant for this derivative would involve computing or estimating the maximum norm of the gradient of the derivative of the kernel function with respect to the input space \( X \).

In practice, computing this constant directly would require explicit knowledge of the kernel function \( k \) and its derivatives, as well as the ability to compute the maximum of the gradient norm, which may be an analytically or computationally challenging problem depending on the complexity of \( k \) and the space \( X \).

For a specific kernel function, one would usually calculate these derivatives and evaluate their norms analytically if possible, or use numerical methods to approximate the maximum if an analytical solution is not feasible.

If you have the explicit form of the kernel function \( k \), I could assist in calculating or estimating its Lipschitz constant. Otherwise, the procedure remains abstract and requires further information.
